# TODO: Reject Arbitrary URL Routes

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create .htaccess file in root directory with RewriteEngine rules to allow specific paths (html/, controllers/, css/, js/, img/, etc.) and deny access to arbitrary routes.
- [ ] Test the .htaccess rules to ensure existing functionality is not broken and arbitrary routes are rejected.
- [ ] Optionally create a custom 404 or forbidden error page for rejected routes.
